                <p>Hello!!
                    My name is Brittany Payne and I am from Athens, GA. 
                    I am 25 years old, and the oldest of my family. My younger sister is 22 and my brother is 16.
                    Needless to say, they are my children. 
                    Over the summer of 2023, I got engaged to my fiance Kellie, and we have 3 dogs and 2 cats.
                    I currently work at a hospital in Athens as a secretary and monitor tech in the Intensive Care Unit. 
                    
                 
                </p>
                <p>
                    After finishing high school, I started driving a school bus while going to Athens Technical College.
                    While there, I graduated with two Associate Degrees: one in Computer Support and the other of Network Specialist.
                    Outside of Athens Tech and Kennesaw State, I have not had any experience with any IT training or certifications. 

                </p>
                <p> 
                    One of my main goals is to get back into the education side of Information Technology.
                    I thought my time with kids would end once I left the bus driving, however, I really enjoyed working with kids.
                    After graduating from Kennesaw State, I have thought about going into education to be able to teach Technology at a middle school level.
                    I'm not entirely sure yet, but that is something I have been thinking about.
